# A small favor.

Could you generate a Gerber file from the origin/footprint branch and actually manufacture the PCB? 
We have implemented a fix for the footprint library link error and KiCAD6 support, but we have not yet been able to manufacture a PCB and test that it really works.
I would be most grateful if you could actually manufacture the PCB based on the footprint branch, check that it works, and report the results to me via Issue in this repository, my twitter, etc.
Thanks in advance.
